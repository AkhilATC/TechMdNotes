# Lombok Java

1. @NonNull
Generate a null check on a setter field, and It throws the NullPointerException
2. @Getter and @Setter 
3. @Data
@Data annotation, Lombok produces getters and setters for every one of the non-static class fields and a class constructor.
4. @AllArgsConstructor and @NoArgsConstructor
The @AllArgsConstructor annotation generates a constructor with all fields that are declared. If any field is added or removed, the constructor is also revised for the changes. The @NoArgsConstructor annotation simply generates the constructor without any argument.
